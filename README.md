# graphml: log normalizing constants for G-Wishart densities

`graphml` is an R package for computing the log normalizing constant of G-Wishart densities based on ideas from the Hybrid approximation methodology (Chuu et. al., 2021) and extended to incorporate higher order approximations and ideas from graphical modeling literature. The link to the correspoding paper will be provided upon commpletion of the preprint.
