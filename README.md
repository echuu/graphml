# graphml: log normalizing constants for G-Wishart densities

`graphml` is an R package for computing the log normalizing constant of G-Wishart densities based on ideas from the Hybrid approximation methodology (Chuu et. al., 2021) and extended to incorporate higher order approximations and ideas from graphical modeling literature. The link to the correspoding paper will be provided upon commpletion of the preprint.

We provide the implementation for the Hybrid-EP + Junction Tree algorithm 

## Installation

Currently, this package is available to be built locally in R. 

## Using the package in practice

See [this demo](https://github.com/echuu/graphml/blob/master/examples/graphml_demo.pdf) for an illustration of how to use this package in practice. The source code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/echuu/graphml/blob/master/examples/graphml_demo.Rmd).
